## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts        # Main Loomtype class
â”œâ”€â”€ cli.ts          # CLI entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts        # TypeScript interfaces
â””â”€â”€ __tests__/      # Integration tests
```

## Testing

- Write integration tests for new features
- Tests go in `src/__tests__/`
- Run tests with `npm test`
- Note: Coverage metrics show 0% because integration tests spawn separate processes, but all functionality is tested

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add types for all parameters and return values
- Keep functions focused and small
- Write clear error messages for users

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning:
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers:
1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create git tag
4. Push to npm registry
